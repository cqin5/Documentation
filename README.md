# Documentation
Repository for General and Design Documentation

## This repository
This repository is intended to track and store organizational and technical documents.  

## Branches
To avoid creating multiple repositories and waste our Github private repository quota, we will have multiple branches in this repository. The master branch will only contain this `README.md`. All others branches contain documentation about a project with the exception of the `general` branch and the `misc` branch.

### Create a branch
To create a new branch, checkout the `master` branch first, and then `git checkout -b new-branch-name`.

### Merge a branch
_DO NOT_ merge anything back onto the `master` branch. _DO NOT_ merge between project branches.
